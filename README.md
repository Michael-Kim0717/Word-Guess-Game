# Word-Guess-Game

The 'Word Guess Game' is a spinoff of the kid's classic Hangman game.

THEME : World Geography (Countries)

Using the keys on your keyboard, you will have 5 chances to guess the corresponding country.
If you correctly guess the country, you will gain another 5 chances to guess another random country and continue your streak.
If you incorrectly guess, you have the option to start over, but your win streak will end.
